                        Financial institutions are facing increasing pressure from stakeholders to prioritize ESG factors. Investors need reliable climate risk forecasts to make informed CapEx decisions and assess the long-term viability of sustainability commitments.                        
                        Zerolytics offers science-based models for benchmarking and predicting climate risk.

                        Through personal referrals, cold-calling, and Linkedin-messaging, I gathered a list of  20 actors in Norwegian asset management companies from analysts to CEOs to interview in order to understand <strong>who </strong>who makes climate investment decisions and <strong>how </strong> these decisions are made. 
                        I constructed the causal-loop diagram above to illustrate my findings around systemic industry issues, and where Zerolytics is positioned to create change.

                        Open-ended user interviews revealed a strong skepticism of current climate scoring solutionsâ€”analysts don't trust "black-box" algorithms and prefer to do the heavy lifting themselves to understand the calculations, despite the time-consuming effort.
