                        For my senior year design capstone, I tackled a challenge that became even more urgent during the pandemic: the loss of community among Stanford students. I designed and built an experience from start to finish to help people reconnect, form deeper bonds, and spark new friendships.

                        Meet Amity—a simple way to spark new connections. It starts when someone hands you a mystery card. At the mirror machine, enter the card’s code to reveal a printed message from the person who passed it to you. The card is then reset, and when you're ready, you can scan the back, write your own message, and pass it on.

                        I built a "acts like" prototype to test the content of the machine to 50 people at a project trade show. People rated the "Quotes" as the most memorable type of content they received.

                    <p class="project-text-text">
                        I noticed that people kept the quotes, tucking them into wallets and phone cases. The other cards dispensed -- riddles, life hacks, and quizzes -- were politely placed back on the table. This showed that meaningful messages made the biggest impact, so I designed Amity with the driving question:

                    I laser-engraved cards with pre-written messages to lower the barrier to sharing gratitude. The cards all start with "pass this along to someone who..." with the options "...you want to thank," "you miss," "you want to get a meal with," and "made you smile."

                        Now understanding that people felt embarrassed passing a card with a visible message, I changed the design. Now, participants scan the card’s code, type a secret message, and pass it along. The recipient prints the message at a kiosk, then can reuse the card to pass the gesture forward.
